# Moopa Wallet Grant Application

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Moopa Wallet
- **Team Name**: IOts Lab
- **Payment Address**: To be provided upon approval
- **Level**: 1
- **License**: Apache 2.0

## Project Description

**Moopa** is the first voice-activated digital wallet project for the Polkadot ecosystem. Our mission is to improve wallet accessibility and convenience, especially for users with disabilities and in emerging markets where literacy and UI complexity are barriers. Users can initiate and confirm transactions through secure voice commands.

The wallet will support DOT and other Substrate-based tokens and will feature:

- Voice payment and authentication
- On-device voice recognition (no 3rd party API required)
- Biometric fallback (fingerprint/face ID)
- A lightweight Polkadot.js integration
- Full compatibility with mobile and desktop platforms

Moopa is currently at the **prototype stage**, being actively developed by **IOts Lab**.

### An Original Innovation for Polkadot

While many wallets focus on features like staking and token swaps, Moopa brings a **unique voice-command layer** and **UX-first accessibility model** that addresses underserved users in the Web3 space, including the visually impaired and those unfamiliar with traditional wallet interfaces.

## Motivation and Value to the Ecosystem

Voice-driven interactions are the future of user experience, especially in mobile-first and accessibility-focused design. Moopa will help:

- Expand Polkadot's user base to non-technical audiences
- Enable easier onboarding for users in low-literacy regions
- Promote inclusive finance
- Serve as an open-source foundation for voice UX tools in other Substrate-based dApps

The open-source nature of this grant ensures that the core voice module and UI/UX flows can be reused and extended by other developers.
